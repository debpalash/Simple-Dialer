A lightweight app for handling your calls, no matter where are you. Comes with a handy call log for easy call initiation.

There is a quick dialpad at your service too, with smart contact suggestions. It supports letters too.

You can easily block phone numbers to avoid unwanted incoming calls.

Supported Speed dialing makes calling your favorite contacts with this true phone a breeze.

It comes with material design and dark theme by default, provides great user experience for easy usage. The lack of internet access gives you more privacy, security and stability than other apps.
